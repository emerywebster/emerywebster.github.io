Not exactly a [full blown backlog](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/backlogs/), but helpful nonetheless. Also tracking technical issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/emerywebster/emerywebster.github.io/issues).

**To Do**

1. [Fix emoji](https://cloudup.com/cXq_pgYPocx) on excerpts (Jekyll issue?)
2. Indent ordered lists
3. Improve formatting for blockquotes (currently just italics with minor indent)
4. Add 'bio' section to home page
5. Add pagination to individual posts
6. Add site search
7. Add category/tag archive pages (better organization)
8. Add [Influences](/influences) page (people, books, blogs)
10. Trim [mobile padding](https://cloudup.com/cfBK6B3HpJn) (by ~50%)
11. Limit content width [for super wide screens](https://cloudup.com/cdxUYqQXM0W ) (~900px)
12. Add other services to header (gyroscope? exposure?)
