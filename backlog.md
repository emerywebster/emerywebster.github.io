Not exactly a [full blown backlog](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/backlogs/) but helpful nonetheless. Also tracking technical issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/emerywebster/emerywebster.github.io/issues).

**To Do** (high)

1. [Fix emoji](https://cloudup.com/cXq_pgYPocx) on excerpts (Jekyll issue?)
2. Add category/tag archive pages (better organization)
3. Add [Influences](/influences) page (people, books, blogs)
4. Add disqus (or commenting of some kind)
5. Add share stuff (for posts only)
6. Trim [mobile padding](https://cloudup.com/cfBK6B3HpJn) (by ~50%)
7. Limit content width [for super wide screens](https://cloudup.com/cdxUYqQXM0W ) (~900px)
