Not exactly a [full blown backlog](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/backlogs/), but helpful nonetheless. Also tracking technical issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/emerywebster/emerywebster.github.io/issues).

**To Do**

1. [Fix emoji](https://cloudup.com/cXq_pgYPocx) on excerpts (Jekyll issue?)
2. Improve formatting for blockquotes (currently just italics with minor indent)
3. Add 'bio' section to home page
4. Add pagination to individual posts
5. Add category/tag archive pages (better organization)
6. Add [Influences](/influences) page (people, books, blogs)
7. Limit content width [for super wide screens](https://cloudup.com/cdxUYqQXM0W ) (~900px)
8. Add site search
9. Add other services to header (gyroscope? exposure?)
