**To Do**

1. [Fix emoji](https://cloudup.com/cXq_pgYPocx) on excerpts (Jekyll issue?)
2. Add 'bio' section to home page
3. Add pagination to individual posts
4. Add category/tag archive pages (better organization)
5. Add [Influences](/influences) page (people, books, blogs)
6. Add site search
7. Add other services to header (gyroscope? exposure?)
