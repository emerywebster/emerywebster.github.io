intro: Foxden is a ridiculously simple, easy-to-use video collaboration product for desktop, mobile, and "in-room" use cases.

When I first joined ReadyTalk, I worked alongside Senior UX Designer, [Nam Nguyen](http://nam-ux.com), to ideate, test, and execute product design for [Foxden](http://foxden.io).

After ~6 months with the company, I became the lead designer for a new product experience: PSTN functionality (which is an overly technical way of saying "send or receive a phone call").
