intro: Foxden is a simple, easy-to-use meeting platform that began as an innovation project at ReadyTalk. After gaining attention (and investment) from ReadyTalk leadership -  we assembled a startup-like team to quickly research, build, and release a solution to market. 
quote: I joined the team shortly after the launch of the initial MVP, and I'm extremely proud of the team and our results. We built a great product -  acquired, retained, and delighted new customers - and exceeded our revenue goals for 2016. I encourage you to take a closer look and consider it as your organization's meeting platform of choice.

When I first joined ReadyTalk, I worked alongside lead designer [Nam Nguyen](http://nam-ux.com) to build, test, and release new features for [Foxden](http://foxden.io) - all with the goal of acquiring and retaining new customers.

Some of my initial contributions included:

- [Invite via desktop](http://ux.emerywebster.com/foxden/desktop-invite/frame.html) [proto.io]
- [Invite via mobile](http://ux.emerywebster.com/foxden/ios/frame.html) [proto.io]
- [Browser permissions](https://invis.io/CXBVAXL95) [invision]
- [Intelligent meeting summaries](https://cloudup.com/clPW0RxQ0Ur) [static]
- [In-room mobile 'remote'](https://cloudup.com/cv-dynIgps8) [static]
- [In-room maintenance mode](https://cloudup.com/cNSCIBaQ_Lp) [static]

### Process

After ~6 months with ReadyTalk, I moved into a lead design role to introduce dial-in/dial-out experiences to Foxden. The process for this feature (and any of the examples above) looked something like this:

{: .list-decimal .list-inside }
1. Research
2. Ideate
3. Prototype
4. Test
5. Launch - Monitor - Repeat

_The rest of this story is still in-progress. In the meantime, please take a moment to review this prototype of the mobile app experience._
