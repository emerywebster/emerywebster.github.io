intro: Foxden is a simple, easy-to-use meeting platform that began as an innovation project at ReadyTalk. After gaining attention (and investment) from ReadyTalk leadership - a startup-like team quickly researched, built, and released a solution to market. 
quote: I joined the team shortly after the launch of the initial MVP, and I'm extremely proud of the team and our results. We built a great product -  acquired, retained, and delighted new customers - and exceeded our revenue goals for 2016. I encourage you to take a closer look and consider it as your organization's meeting platform of choice.

When I first joined ReadyTalk, I worked alongside lead designer [Nam Nguyen](http://nam-ux.com) to build, test, and release new features for [Foxden](http://foxden.io) - all with the goal of acquiring and retaining new customers.

My initial contributions to the project included:

- Mobile & Desktop
    - Screenshare
    - Browser permissions (mic + webcam access)
    - Recordings
    - Intelligent meeting summaries
    - Invite participants
- In-room (aka 'Foxden Connect')
    - Connectivity via laptop
    - Connectivity via mobile
    - Maintenance mode

_Please [contact me](/contact) for specific examples of work. Thanks!_

After ~6 months with ReadyTalk, I moved into a lead design role to introduce dial-in/dial-out experiences to Foxden. The process for building any new feature looked something like this:

1. Research
2. Ideate
3. Prototype
4. Test
5. Launch - Monitor - Repeat

_The rest of this story is still in-progress. In the meantime, please take a moment to review the below prototype of the mobile app experience._
