When I first joined ReadyTalk, I worked alongside Senior UX Designer, [Nam Nguyen](http://nam-ux.com), to ideate, test, and execute product design for [Foxden](http://foxden.io).

After ~6 months with the company, I moved into a lead design role for a new Foxden experience: PSTN functionality (which is a quick way of saying "send or receive a phone call").
