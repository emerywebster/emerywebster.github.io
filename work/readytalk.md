title: ReadyTalk Customer Experience
permalink: work/readytalk
intro: In 2016, I worked with various cross-fuctional teams at ReadyTalk to understand, quantify, improve, and monitor any touchpoint that our customers had with the brand/product. We gathered insights from customers and internal stakeholders to identify where we succeeded, where we fell short, and where we could invest to make the greatest impact to the business and our customers.
