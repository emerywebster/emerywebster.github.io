permalink: work/readytalk
intro: In 2016, I worked with various cross-fuctional teams at ReadyTalk to understand, improve, and monitor each touchpoint between our brand/product and our customers. We gathered insights from customers and internal stakeholders to identify where we succeeded, where we fell short, and where we could invest to make the greatest impact to the business and our customers.
