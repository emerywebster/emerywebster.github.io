intro: In 2016, I worked with ReadyTalk's Director of Customer Experience, Kim Wachtel, and various cross-functional teams in an effort to review, quantify, and improve our overall customer experience. We gathered many insights from our customers and internal teams to identify where we succeeded, where we fell short, and where we could invest to make the greatest impact to the business and our customers.
