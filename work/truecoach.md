  <p>TrueCoach enables fitness coaches and personal trainers (and some other surprising use cases) to be more effective and improve their business.</p>
  <p>I joined the team as the <strong>first product designer</strong> in 2017. With little outside investment, we grew from 6 to 25+ people and experienced 2-3x year-over-year revenue growth before being acquired in March, 2020.</p>
  <p>Throughout that time, I've <strong>shipped</strong> many experiences that improved the lives of our coaches and clients. I also built and maintained our <strong>CSS framework</strong> &amp; <strong>design system</strong>, initiated a <strong>culture</strong> team to communicate ideas upward, and established a hiring process for our design team.</p>
