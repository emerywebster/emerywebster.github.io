**Problem –** With many gyms closing in March & April of 2020, our customers needed a quick way to adapt to their clients' limited access to equipment.

**Solution –** During a team <a href="https://truecoach.co/careers/" class="link--highlight" target="_blank">investment day</a>, I partnered with a front end engineer to explore how coaches might more easily build at-home workouts for clients. We introduced a <code>bodyweight</code> tag to our exercise library and introduced new UI to easily find them while building workouts.

**Outcome –** While the solution below was never fully implemented, we learned that a <code>bodyweight</code> exercise tag provided a quick and inexpensive way to address the problem and proactively support our customers.
