**Problem –** Coaches were able to manage every aspect of their client relationship _except_ for payment processing (opting instead to use Paypal, Venmo, cash, and other methods). This inhibited some prospective leads from becoming paying customers and left a valuable new revenue stream untouched.

**Solution –** We integrated with <a href="https://stripe.com/connect/platforms" target="_blank" class="link--highlight">Stripe Connect</a> and released a Minimum [insert adjective of choice here] Product that included pricing plans, recurring subscriptions, payouts, and baseline reporting and analytics.

**Outcome –** Since launching in late 2019, we've seen 22% adoption among our US-based customers and processed hundreds of thousands of coach/client transactions. The revenue potential is also on pace to outgrow our original subscription model within the next 2-3 years.
