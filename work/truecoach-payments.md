**Problem –** Coaches need client nutrition data to be effective, but clients weren't using our nutrition logging features.

**Solution –** Give clients a simple way to connect their <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/api" target="_blank" class="link--highlight">MyFitnessPal</a> account. Coaches get the nutrition data they need, and clients continue using their meal tracking tool of choice.

**Outcome –** We saw immediate adoption of this feature, increased NPS, and converted many potential customers who were "waiting for this feature".
