**Problem –** Customers were unable to upgrade their payment plan beyond a set of entry-level options. This caused frustrastion, slowed revenue growth, and added unnecessary support costs.

**Solution –** Alongside <a href="http://twitter.com/joeymurdah" class="link--highlight" target="_blank">another designer</a>, we led a cross-functional team to build a faster and simpler account management experience.

**Outcome –** Our customer support team reported a near 100% reduction in related conversations in <a href="http://intercom.com" class="link--highlight" target="_blank">Intercom</a>.

:point_up: That's the TLDR. You'll find more context below.

#### Problem

TrueCoach's pricing model is based on the number of clients within an organization. More clients -> more money. 

Originally, we provided these options within the product:

<div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg p-6">
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
    <li><span class="font-bold">1 to 5 clients</span>: $</li>
    <li><span class="font-bold">6 to 25 clients</span>: $$</li>
    <li><span class="font-bold">26 to 50 clients</span>: $$$</li>
    <li class="mb-3"><span class="font-bold">More than 50 clients</span>: Contact us</li>
    <small>The familiar SaaS pricing model that you see pretty much everywhere.</small>
  </ul>
</div>

In reality, there were another ~20 hidden pricing tiers that we would show customers when they inevitably grew and reached out to us.

Through initial research and discovery, our cross functional team identified the following core problem to solve: **allow coaches to upgrade/downgrade to any pricing plan without intervention** (up to a point where we suggested a white glove offering).

We also uncovered the following problems along the user journey:

🤔 Confusion of monthly vs yearly pricing<br>
🤔 Uncertain of time remaining in free trial<br>
😕 Difficulty activating account during free trial<br>
😕 Difficulty changing plans once activated<br>
🤷‍♀️ Lack of access to onboarding material after sign up<br>
🤷‍♀️ Lack of data to learn why customers canceled their accounts

#### Solution

As a cross-functional team, we collaboratively stepped through the following activities during research and solution meetings.

{: .list-decimal .list-inside }
1. Outlined the current user journey & identified primary pain points.
2. Drew and discussed new work flows and solutions.
3. Developed an end-to-end prototype for internal reviewing and testing.
4. Broke the work into pieces to ship and monitor/measure incrementally.
