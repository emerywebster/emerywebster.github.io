intro: In early 2017, I interviewed with SendGrid - a communication platform for transational and marketing email. As part of the interview process, they asked me to participate in a design challenge to present to their team.
quote: Imagine that you are a design intern at a new marketing agency. Your boss has asked at the last minute that you put together an email to send to about 100 clients announcing your upcoming holiday event. You have very limited experience with HTML or sending emails and the agency doesnâ€™t have an email tool in place yet. So you set off to Google to find a tool and stumble upon SendGrid.
