**Problem –** When I first joined the team, our coaches were still using spreadsheets to track their athlete's performance and progression. This made theme less efficient and less effective when developing training programs.

**Solution –** After learning how and why our coaches needed to track their athletes' goals and progression, we delivered <a href="https://truecoach.co/features/metrics/" class="link--highlight">Metrics</a> – a tool that provided the history and background coaches needed while planning and programming. 

**Outcome –** Outside of workout creation and delivery, metrics quickly became our most popular supplemental coaching feature.

#### My role

We began working on metrics in mid-to-late 2017. At the time we were a team of 7 (with the <a class="link--highlight" href="http://twitter.com/yeabuddy">CEO</a> still a regular contributor to the code base – which was really fun and deserves its own blog post) – so we all wore many hats and contributed heavily to every aspect of the product. 

I led research and design, which included:

- Interviewing and observing how coaches approached these problems at the time.
- Drafting new concepts via whiteboarding, sketches, and mockups.
- Prototyping, testing, and validating solutions with customers prior to development.
- Dev assists (mostly `css` and templating contributions to <a href="https://emberjs.com/" class="link--highlight">Ember</a> components).
- Responding to wins and shortcomings via <a href="http://intercom.com" class="link--highlight">Intercom</a>.
