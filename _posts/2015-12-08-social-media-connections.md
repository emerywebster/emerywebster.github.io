Today I had a simple, yet totally profound interaction on Twitter. Here's what happened: While reading [Dan Olsen](https://twitter.com/danolsen)'s [The Lean Product Playbook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Product-Playbook-Innovate/dp/1118960874) I found myself with a lot of unanswered questions &mdash; primarily around his central case study (which is used to illustrate his lean process with an actual product). I tried Google... Nothing. Then I thought, _why not just ask him?_

Twitter provided the easiest path, and within an hour he followed me back and provided an answer:

<blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/emerywebster">@emerywebster</a> good question :-) The MVP validation after we pivoted led the company to acquire a startup in that space</p>&mdash; Dan Olsen (@danolsen) <a href="https://twitter.com/danolsen/status/674391006851166208">December 9, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</p>

Admittedly, this answer left me half-satisfied (and with even more questions)...but still, he got back to me. _Within an hour._ 

For some reason I didn't expect to get a response. I'm not sure why. Dan only has about 4k followers...but he's a busy guy: best-selling author, speaker, business consultant, high profile silicon valley guy, etc. Still, it felt like a pretty cool move.

My point is that even quick and seemingly insignificant touch points like this can leave your readers/users/fans/whatever feeling pretty special. 

[Gary Vaynerchuk](http://twitter.com/garyvee) is the king of this kind of thing&mdash;constantly building and engaging with his audience/customer/community through various social touchpoints. About a year ago I was looking for a video interview of him and reached out to see if he could point me in the right direction. Within _minutes_ he reached back to me, cc'ing a partner/employee of his to help me out. I had the video link[^1] within 20 minutes.

This is a guy with _millions_ of social connections, running multiple businesses, and is certainly much busier than most. He's basically moving 120mph 120% of the time...so it was reassuring to see that he walked the talk when I raised my hand.

One of my favorite quotes of his:

> If youâ€™re hustling, good shit will happen. Period. What the hustle looks like varies. All I ask for is that you work hard and fast.[^2]

I highly recommend you give him a follow on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/garyvee) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@garyvee). After digging a bit I'm sure you'll learn something new (and understand why he's so successful).
