I use an alias in my **~/.gitconfig** called `git hist`[^1], which looks like this:

    {% highlight bash %}
    hist = log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative
    {% endhighlight %}

And outputs as (using this site as an example):

![git hist command output](/img/2015-10-06-git-hist.jpg)

It's insanely helpful **but I had no idea how it worked (or what it meant)** until just now.

So, here's a quick look at what I learned:

- `hist = log` : create/start the alias identical to `git log`
- `--graph` : adds graphic on the left side to 'illustrate' commits, merges, rebases, etc.
- `--pretty=format:[options]` : show certain details (placeholders) about each commit and format them as specified.

Below is a list of those placeholders used here[^2]:

- `%h` = abbreviated hash
- `%d` = ref name
- `%s` = subject (message in the commit; not decorated)
- `%cr` = committer date
- `%an` = author name 

Colors are then added  via `%C[color-name]%[text-to-color]%Creset`[^3].

**Back to the point** &mdash; the whole reason I started down this path is because I didn't know how or why the refs are shown as they are:

    (HEAD, origin/master, [other]/master], master)

I knew what `HEAD` meant (sort of). I knew what `master` meant (for sure). And I _think_ I understood what was happening with `origin/master`.

Again, after more digging, I've found a more concise explanation:

- **HEAD** : A reference to the last commit in the current checked out branch (via [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2529971/what-is-the-head-in-git)).
- **origin/master** : A reference to the remote you cloned the repo from...and where it will push to.
- **[other]/master** : Additional remotes that you can push to. In the case of Hartl's rails tutorial, I have one that deploys to heroku via `git push heroku`.
- **master** : The branch I'm using and committing to locally.

It's worth noting that I can use `git remote show origin` and `git remote show heroku` to see where they each point.

Whew! This took a while but even if it doesn't stick I'll have a place to jump back to! :octocat:
