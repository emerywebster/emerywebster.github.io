...is one of the most helpful and insightful business books I've read. If you're reading this and have any interest in building a new idea (or gathering better feedback in general) definitely [pick it up](http://www.amazon.com/The-Mom-Test-customers-business/dp/1492180742) now. 

Rather than regurgitating and summarizing its key points (which I end up doing below anyway) I'll showcase an example of [Rob Fitzpatrick](http://twitter.com/robfitz)'s style. 

---

_The following example comes from Chapter 3, which is about asking important questions &mdash; in this case starting with generics before zooming down into a real problem._

<div style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:1em;">

<p><strong><u>A (really, really) bad converation</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>You:</strong> "Hi. Thanks for taking the time. We're building phone and tablet apps to help people stay in shape and just wanted to understand how you stay fit." <em>This isn't a terrible opening, but I'd generally avoid mentioning the idea unless I have to, since it does bias them.</em></p>

<p><strong>Them:</strong> "Okay." <em>I never exercise, so this should be quick.</em></p>

<p><strong>You:</strong> "How often do you got to the gym?" <em>This sort of demographic data doesn't give you any insight, but can be useful for figuing out what sort of person you're talking to so you can ask relevant follow ups.</em></p>

<p><strong>Them:</strong> "Not really ever." <em>Well, looks like we're done here!</em></p>

<p><strong>You:</strong> "What would you say is your biggest problem with going to the gym?" <em>This is where the conversation goes horribly wrong. Instead of figuring out whether staying fit is actually a real problem, we're prematurely zooming in on it. Any response here is going to be dangerously misleading.</em></p>

<p><strong>Them:</strong> "I guess it takes time to get there. I'm always kind of busy, you know?" <em>Wait, who says I have a problem with going to the gym? I thought I just told you I don't care about the gym! But if I had to choose one, I guess I'd go with convenience. Not that I've done a pushup in 5 years. Pushup are pretty convenient.</em></p>

<p><strong>You:</strong> Perfect. That's great. And can you rank these 4 in terms of which is most important to you in a fitness program: convenience, personalization, novelty, or cost? <em>Note that we're still assuming we're talking to a person who actually cares about getting in shape. Questions like this don't tell you if the person cares about any of it at all.</em></p>

<p><strong>Them:</strong> Probably convenience, then cost, then personalization, then novelty. <em>Since you asked, I'll anser. Hypothetically speaking, of course.</em></p>

<p><strong>You:</strong> Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much. We're working on an app that will help you exercise in the convenience of your own home. I think it's going to be a great fit for what you care about. <em>Totally missing the point and mis-interpreting the conversation as validation. Now fishing for compliments.</em></p>

<p><strong>Them:</strong> Cool. I'd love to try it when it launches. <em>Half-hearted compliment plus non-committal stalling tactic.</em></p>

<p><strong>You:</strong> Great &mdash; I'll send over one of our beta keys so you can check it out. <em>We got a user!</em></p>

<p><strong>Them:</strong> Thanks! <em>I'm literally never going to type that in.</em></p>

Notes[^1] I took on the book while reading...because I'm a psychopath:

### KEY POINTS

**1. The Test**

- Ask questions that pass the Mom Test
    - Don't talk about your idea...instead discuss their life/constraints/problems/goals
    - Ask for specifics from the past rather than generics or opinions about the future
- They own the problem, you own the solution

**2. Avoid Bad Data**

- Deflect compliments (dig for specifics) and anchor fluff (identify actual examples)
- Determine the motivations behind ideas/requests

**3. Ask Important Questions**

- "Every time you talk to someone you should be having at least one question that has the potential to destroy your currently imagined business."
- For unpleasant tasks...imagine what you would have someone else do if you were delegating it. Then do it.
- You're learning, not selling. The best answers might showcase that they don't really care e.g. "that's kinda cool" or "not sure about that..."
- Don't try to up your game / sell more. If anything, dig further to understand their apathy (rather than convincing them of your idea).
- Look before you zoom
- Understand product risk

**4. Keep it Casual**

- Steve Blank recommends 3 meetings in _4 Steps_ to:
    - Talk about their problem
    - Talk about their solution
    - Present/sell your product
    - (good in theory but can be quite time consuming in practice)
- Strip the formality ("If it feels like they're doing a favor by talking to you, it's probably too formal.")
- Early (problem-identifying) conversations should be no more than 5 minutes &mdash; all you're doing is identifying if a problem exists and if it's important.
- Later conversations might require a bit of storytelling on their part e.g. show me how you're doing x now, what else have you tried, etc. 
- Once you have a product and the meeting takes on a more sales-oriented tone you'll want ~30 minute blocks

**5. Commitment and Advancement**

- Actually showcasing your product/idea will inevitably invite lots of compliments (false positives)...you can cut through that by asking for commitment.
- Meetings should either _succeed_ (commitment advance to the next step) or _fail_.
- If you don't know what happens next then the meeting was pointless.
- There are different types of _currency_:
    - [Time] next meeting with known goal
    - [Reputation risk] intro to decision-maker
    - [Financial] pre-order / letter of intent
- It's not a real lead until they've give you a concrete chance to reject you.
- When you see a customer with deep emotion for what you're doing, keep them close (they're the earlyvangelist you're looking for). 
- In early stage sales, the goal is still learning. Revenue is a side effect.

**6. Finding Conversations**

- Cold calling is a bear but it can work (98 out of 100 rejections still gives you to conversations to go on).
- Utilize serendipidous situations (no excuses or formalities needed...just ask about their life).
- You can bring them to you or (more preferably) seek out warm intros
    - 7 degrees, university professors, top-tier investors
- "People like to help entrepreneurs...but also hate wasting their time. Tell them what they need to know and that it will make a real difference."
- You're going to get ignored a lot...but who cares?
- Don't approach these meetings looking for _customers_ -- instead you are looking for industry and customer _advisors_. This way you're evaluating them rather than the other way around (if it has a 'sales' feel).
- The UX community suggests that you should keep talking to people until you stop hearing new information.

**7. Choosing Your Customers**

- "If you aren't finding consistent problems and goals, you don't have a specific enough customer segment."
- Customer splicing should provide two helpful groups:
    - A collection of demographics
    - A set of goals/motivations
- Once you have a bunch of who-where pairs...you can decide who to start with based on who seems most:
    - Profitable/big
    - Easy to reach
    - Personally rewarding
- Don't spend forever on it. Just spend enough time finding a concrete initial segment so you can find a few of them and move the business forward.
- Understand if you are selling to businesses with complicated buying processes and have overlooked some of the stakeholders (need to understand all of the goals and constraints).

**8. Running the Process**

- Share learning with the entire team promptly and faithfully (get the info out of your head and in a permanent sharable place).
- Prep
    - Ensure you know your 3 big questions.
    - If it can be answered with desk research...do it now.
    - If you alread know about your customers then you can approach it with an existing set of beliefs that you're updating.
    - Don't need to spend a ton of time on this...just enough prep to ensure you're learning something, covering everyone's concerns, and not wasting other peoples' time.
- Review
    - Overview of notes and the three questions.
    - Meta-conversation about the conversation can be helpful.
    - Chat window for customer learning is helpful.
- During
    - Notes: add symbols for emotions, their life, tasks, specifics.
    - Keep it casual.
    - Deflect compliments, anchor fluff, etc.
    - If possible, press for commitment and next steps.
- After
    - With team, review notes and customer quotes.
    - Update beliefs and plans.
    - Identify next 3 big questions (if necessary).
- Don't spend forever on any of this...get your learnings and then give them something to commit to (the goal with all of this is to make your business move faster, not slower).

### 1. The Mom Test

Here it is:

1. Talk about their life rather than your idea 
2. Ask for specifics from the past rather than generics or opinions about the future 
3. Talk less and listen more 

(If it goes well they won't even know you have an idea)

- only the market can tell if your idea is good or not (opinions are worthless)
- anything involving the future is an over-optimistic lie 
- people will lie to you if they think it's what you want to hear
- people know what their problems are...but don't necessarily know how to solve them (motivations and constraints around why they want something is valuable than what they think they may want in feature x, y, z)
- you're shooting blind until you understand their goals ("why bother?")
- some problems don't actually matter (is this an "I'll pay for a solution" problem or a "not that big of a deal" problem?)
- watching someone perform a task will show you the actual inefficiencies and problems...not what the subject thinks they are
- **if they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not going to look for (or buy) yours**
- people stop lying when you ask them for money 
- it's rare for someone to tell you what they would pay you...but they'll often show you what it's worth to them 
- "who else should I talk to?" and "is there anything else I should have asked" (if needed) are great ways to end most interviews 

In summary: you want to understand your customers problems, cares, constraints, goals

They own the problem, you own the solution. 

---

### 2. Avoiding Bad Data 

Three types of bad data:

1. compliments
2. fluff (generics, hypotheticals, the future)
3. ideas

**Deflecting compliments** -- they're distracting and tend to be used as an indication that the meeting just "went well". Dig for specifics so you can actually validate if you can solve their problem (or if their problem is too small to require your solution).

**Anchoring fluff** -- talk through what actually happens (find examples) rather than what "usually happens".

Identify complainers vs. customers (as in "I would definitely by that!" but not even try one when asked to)

Anchor people on the life they already lead and the actions they're already taking.

When you hear a request, it's your job to understand the motivations behind it.

- Why do you want that? 
- What would that let you do?
- How are you coping without it?

Similarly...any strong emotion is worth exploring. Dig through those to understand where they're coming from.

- Tell me more about that.
- That seems to really bug you...is there a story there?
- What makes it so awful?
- Go on...

**Approval seeking**

If you've mentioned your idea, people will try to protect your feelings.

**Cut off pitches**

You get excited and go into pitch mode, they go silent, suddently they stop talking about their problems.

**Talk less**

Don't interrupt (either for 'fill in the blank' type conversations or raise a new topic you have a really good answer to).

Let the customer give you a glimpse of their mental model of the world. They are trying to help you so do not cut them off.

---

### 3. Asking Important Questions

Don't shrink from the important questions -- "Every time you talk to someone you should be having at least one question that has the potential to destroy your currently imagined business."

For unpleasant tasks...imagine what you would have someone else do if you were delegating it. Then do that.

Learning your beliefs are wrong is frustrating...but it's progress—bringing you closer to the truth of a real problem and a good market.

You're learning, not selling. The best answers might showcase that they don't really give a shit : "that's kinda cool"..."not sure about that."

Don't try to up your game / sell more. If anything, dig further to understand their apathy (rather than convincing them of your idea).

- Is the "problem" not really a big deal?
- Are they fundamentally different from your ideal customer?
- Do they not care about the specific implementation?
- Are they tired of similar pitches?

You can't build your business on a lukewarm response. 

**Look before you zoom** -- don't overlook big problems and zoom into specifics too quickly...otherwise it's a wasted conversation with misleading information (big source of false positives). Again, dig into motivations and anchor generics. Key take away is to start broad.

Is there risk within your product? (if you're asking questions about whether or not people basically want free money e.g. affiliate marketing or ad networks or whatever then it's just a matter of building the product (on your end) or getting the kind of traffic required for those affiliates/ads to pay. It just works.)

Video games are an example of pure product risk. _Do you like having fun?_ Obviously. 

=> If you've got heavy product risk then you're not going to be able to prove much of your business through conversations alone. Those conversations will just give you a starting point. 

Keep a list of your big 3 questions. 

---

### 4. Keeping it Casual

Steve Blank recommends 3 meetings in _4 Steps_ to:

1. Talk about their problem
2. Talk about their solution
3. Present/sell your product

Good in theory but tougher in practice. Plus...how do you find these people? Rob Fitz had pretty much zero friendly contacts when entering a new industry with high walls.

Strip all the formality. When you do so you end up with no meetings, no "interviews", and a much easier time all around. You can gather much more info from casual conversations at a meetup that a lengthy formal meeting... 

You can get to the formal part when actually talking about your solution or your product (but not when you're learning about their problems).

> If it feels like they're doing a favor by talking to you, it's probably too formal.

Early (problem-identifying) conversations should be no more than 5 minutes &mdash; all you're doing is identifying if a problem exists and if it's important.

Later conversations might require a bit of storytelling on their part e.g. show me how you're doing x now, what else have you tried, etc. 

Once you have a product and the meeting takes on a more sales-oriented tone you'll want ~30 minute blocks (~15 of which will likely be spent actually discussing their problems/goals and presenting the product). 

Even formal meetings can be casual. Break into it during small talk if possible. Give as little information as possible about your idea while still nudging the conversation in a useful direction.

---

### 5. Commitment and Advancement

Once you've learned enough about your customers it's time to start revealing your idea and showcasing your product.

This inevitably invites lots of compliments (false positives)...but you can cut through that by **asking for commitment**.

**Meetings either succeed or fail** : a meeting succeeds when you get commitment to advance for the next step...but forcing them to drag without clear next step wastes everyone's time. This is likey because you are fishing for compliments or not asking for a clear commitment or next step.

_If you don't know what happens next after a product or sales meeting...the meeting was pointless._

**Currencies of conversation** (doesn't necessarily have to be cash):

- [Time] next meeting with known goal
- [Time] sitting down to give feedback over wireframes
- [Time] using a trial of the product for a non-trivial period
- [Reputation risk] intro to peers or team
- [Reputation risk] intro to decision-maker
- [Reputationrisk] public testimonial or case study
- [Financial] letter of intent
- [Financial] pre-order 
- [Financial] deposit

**The more they're giving up, the more seriously you can take what they're saying.**

"Let me know when it launches." => ask if they want to be an alpha user and a case stufy for launch. Otherwise it's a fluff stalling tactic.

"I can (do x) when you're ready" => Convert fuzzy promises into something concrete. Understand what _ready_ means and determine why not do x now (e.g. introduction to others)?

> The reason Kickstarter is so wondeful is because it forces customers who say that would buy it to actually pull out a credit card and commit.

It's not a real lead until they've give you a concrete chance to reject you.

When you see a customer with deep emotion for what you're doing, keep them close (they're the earlyvangelist you're lookingn for). 

_In early stage sales, the goal is still learning. Revenue is a side effect._

---

### 6. Finding Conversations

Easy to do find other customers if you're scratching your own itch with your idea...but others?

Cold calling is a bear, but doable. If you are rejected 98 out of 100 times then you still have 2 conversations in play...which can still be significant (and obviously helpful).

Serendipity -- don't think of them as interviews. You're just interested in them and their problems...and you'll learn a lot while appearing to just have a casual conversation.

**The only thing people like talking about more than themselves is their problems.**

No excuses or formalities needed...just ask about their life.

Find an excuse...just chat about the topic, your idea never needs to come into play (sadly these are typically one time convos since you will lose trust if you bring up your idea/intention).

**Landing pages** -- can be helfpul but you should be somewhat skeptical with the metrics. Conversations that stem from sign ups might be more beneficial.

Bringing them to you:

- Organize meetups
- Speaking/teaching
- Get clever (every business is different, don't just copy someone else)

Warm intros:

- Ask, ask, ask of people you know (7 degrees)
- Try to get in touch with advisors of other companies (and potential advisors for you)
- University professors are a gold mine
- Top-tier investors
- Call in on favors from people who said they'd be willing to help at some point

You're goingn to get ignored a lot...but who cares?

**Asking for and Framing the Meeting**

- Vision / Framing / Weakness / Pedestal / Ask ("very few wizards properly ask [for advice]")

People like to help entrepreneurs...but also hate wasting their time. Tell them what they need to know and that it will make a real difference.

In the meeting: repeat your email (more or less) and start askingn good questions. Otherwise they're liable to start drilling you on your idea, forcing you into pitch mode and out of learning.

Cold emails are more difficult. Try to find ways to generate warm intros instead.

Try to start these conversations in person whenever possible. 

Don't approach these meetings looking for **customers** -- instead you are looking for industry and customer **advisors**. This way you're evaluating them...rather than the other way around (if it has a 'sales' feel).

The UX community suggests that you should **keep talking to people until you stop hearing new information**.

---

### 7. Choosing Your Customers

Customer segmentation is important (most startups drown...they don't starve).

When you have a fuzzy sense of who you're serving you end up with 3 problems:

1. You get overwhelmed by options and don't know where to start
2. You aren't moving forward but you can't prove yourself wrong
3. You receive mixed feedback and can't make sense of it

Having 20 conversations with a similar customer can be just as confusing as having the same conversation with 20 different types of customer (e.g. "students".) You just get inconsistent feedback.

> If you aren't finding consistent problems and goals, you don't have a specific enough customer segment.

Use **customer splicing** — divide your group into different segments and ask who would want this the most? Why? Does everyone in that group have that motivation or only some? What additional motivations are there? Which other types of people have these motivations?

This should split everything into two groups:

1. A collection of demographic groups
2. A set of goals/motivations

Once you have a bunch of who-where pairs...you can decide who to start with based on who seems most:

1. Profitable/big
2. Easy to reach
3. Personally rewarding

Don't spend forever on it. Just spend enough time finding a concrete initial segment so you can find a few of them and move the business forward.

Other ways to end up talking to the wrong people and gathering unclear/insufficient data:

- You have multiple customer segments and missed some of them
- You are selling to businesses with complicated buying processes and have overlooked some of the stakeholders (need to understand all of the goals and constraints)

---

### 8. Running the Process

The 'before' and 'after' is key. 

Do not approach follow up meetings with "the customer said so" -- telling people "what I learned" is essentially the equivalent of "what you'll do". Not good.

Learning must be shared with the entire team promptly and faithfully.

Avoiding any bottlenecks comes in three parts:

**Prepping**

- Ensure you know your list of 3 big questions (make a point to face the scary ones)
- (If you've already learned some facts about your customers) it's easier if you have an existing set of beliefs you're updating to stay on track. 
- If you come across any questions that need require some desk research, do it so you can move past them in meetings and find insights that internet searches won't give you.
- Ensure all parts of your company are represented when preparing questions for the customer (ensure all concerns are covered)
- It's possible you'll get a grumpy founder who is not fond of the idea of talking to customers...you can ask them to humour them or just wait it out to showcase that you're actually saving time and not costing it.
- You don't need to spend a ton of time on this...just enough prep to ensure you're learning something, covering everyone's concerns, and not wasting other peoples' time.

**Reviewing**

Simple, just ensure learning is on paper and in front of everyone instead of tied up in your head. Just reviewing your notes and covering the three big questions is usually enough. 

Also worthwhile to have a meta-conversation about the conversation. What can we do next time, are there any signals we missed, etc?

And _open chat window_ for customer learning is a great idea.

**Who should show**

Any important decision makers should come to the occasional customer conversation.

Meetings go best with two people (one asker and one note taker / balancer).

**Taking notes**

Super critical for sharing learning. Also makes it harder to lie to yourself.

Write down exact quotes whenever possible.

- Add symbols to your notes for context/shorthand.
- Any strong emotion is worth noting
    - :) // :( // :|
- Their life (come up with your own)
    - pain/problem
    - goal
    - obstacle
    - workaround
    - background/context
- Specifics (come up with your own)
    - feature request or purchasing criteria
    - money or budgets or purchasing process
    - mentioning a specific person or company
    - follow-up task

**Managing notes**

- Able to be sorted, mixed, and re-arranged
- Able to be combined with the notes of the rest of your team
- Permanent and retrievable
- Not mixed in with other random noise like to-do lists and ideas

Rob finds index cards the most useful (one quote/learning + signal icon per card, with date + who you spoke with).

**Rob's process for staying on track**

_Before a batch of conversation:_

- Choose a focused, findable segment
- With your team, decide your big 3 learning goals
- If relevant, decide on ideal next steps and commitments
- If conversations are the right tool, figure out who to talk to
- Create a series of best guesses about what the person cares about
- If a question could be answered via desk research, do that first

_During a batch of conversation:_

- Frame the conversation
- Keep it casual
- Ask good questions which pass the Mom Test
- Deflect compliments, anchor fluff, and dig beneath signals
- Take good notes
- If relevant, press for commitment and next steps

_After a batch of conversation:_

- With your team, review your notes and key customer quotes
- If relevant, transfer notes into permanent storage
- Update your beliefs and plans
- Decide on the next 3 big questions

---

Do this all quickly. Spend an hour prepping and then go talk to people. The point is to make your business move faster, not slower.

Spend a week doing customer conversations. Get your learnings and then give them something to commit to.
