So...I have a food blog now. And yeah, it's extremely clichÃ©...but **who cares**? I'm pretty sure worse things happen on the internet. Here's the story... ðŸŒ¶

## Some Background

#### I love spicy food

- I collect hot sauces (seriously).
- I add unreasonable amounts of heat to everything.
- I'm into _inferno / diablo / hellfire_ food challenges :fire:.
    - I have a handful of free T-shirts (and 'pictures on the wall') to prove it.
- I believe exciting food = exciting life.

#### I love writing

- Writing is fun.
- No further explanation required.

#### I love sharing

- If I experience something great (in tech, music, food, whatever), I'll push it onto anyone who will listen.
- I recently discovered a hot sauce that was so good that I felt compelled to share it with people I know.
- I thought: _Why not extend my capacity to share with...everyone?_ 
- Then I thought: _Why not seek and share other spicy experiences as well?_

## The Result

So, I snagged a clever domain name (I hope?) and a handful of matching social media accounts. Then I set up a quick WordPress site and added some initial content.

The concept, for now, is [SpiceGuide](http://spicegui.de) &mdash; my tribute to spicy food. If nobody uses it (or cares), that's totally fine. I'll still enjoy having a place to share great recipes, products, and restaurants/dishes that I find worthwhile. If it evolves into something bigger, awesome.

I just got started this a few days ago (and am still testing a handful of ideas/content)...but hopefully the momentum continues to build.

Thoughts? Suggestions? Let me know!
