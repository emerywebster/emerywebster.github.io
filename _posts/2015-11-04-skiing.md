Last year I began the process of switching from :snowboarder: to :ski: &mdash; trying out new equipment, falling a lot, harnessing my inner [Jerry](http://instagram.com/jerryoftheday). Like anything else it required a bit of patience (and some pain) but I'm excited to get back up there and get better.

To make matters worse, about a month ago I went ahead and pulled the trigger on some [new skis](http://www.onthesnow.com/news/a/591096/2015-men-s-all-mountain-back-editors--choice-ski--blizzard-bonafide). Every day since has felt like a 5 year old on the night before Christmas. I cannot wait to clip them in.

For the second year in a row I also picked up the [Mountain Collective](http://mountaincollective.com) pass (**highly** recommend). I was fortunate enough to get out to Aspen and Jackson Hole in 2014/2015...and hope to venture back there again this season (along with Taos, Alta + Snowbird, and others).

Oh, why am I writing this? Because it's snowing in Colorado (like [right f*cking now](http://arapahoebasin.com/ABasin/snow-conditions/web-cams.aspx)) and it's all I can think about :satisfied:.
