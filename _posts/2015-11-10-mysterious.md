Last night I went on a mini TED binge and somehow ended on the path of public speaking (and confidence in general). Throughout [The 7 Secrets of the Greatest Speakers in History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0a61wFaF8A), Robert Greene compiles some incredible speeches to discuss why (and how) the speeches themselves served as tipping points in American history.

There were actually a few that I'd never seen or heard before...and at one point he showcases this little treasure (which was the only one he didn't have audio/video for):

> The most beautiful and deepest 
> experience a man can have is the sense
> of the mysterious...
> 
> To sense that behind anything that can
> be experienced there is a something that
> our mind cannot grasp and whose
> beautify and simplicity are but a feeble
> reflection...
> 
> To me it suffices to wonder at these 
> secrets and to attempt humbly to grasp
> with my mind a mere image of the lofty
> structure of all that there is.
> 
> &mdash;Albert Einstein

Heavy stuff.

So many aspects of the human experience are entirely mysterious (and will likely remain that way for quite a while). From the size/age of the universe...to the the complexity of the human brain...it seems at times that we really have no idea what's going on with this surrounding context.

**But that's alright.** And as Einstein says, that contemplation itself is a beautiful one. Plus we manage to inch our way toward uncovering these secrets as we go forward.

I clearly took a hard left turn to super-deep existential land here...but while we're at it take a few mintues to watch of my favorite Neil Degrasse Tyson videos:
