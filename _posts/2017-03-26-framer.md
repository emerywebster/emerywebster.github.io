Prototyping is easily my favorite component of the design process. It's the best opportunity to test your vision for an actual product experience (and better understand any assumptions, hypotheses, and decisions made along the way). Plus it's a lot of fun to build out your ideas with some movement and personality.

**TL;DR - thinking about designs 'as code' has been an incredibly helpful and powerful tool. Below are some Framer examples that I recently put together...as well as a list of recommended resources to get started.**

- [Random Click/Tap Animations](https://framer.cloud/uBiLd/)
- [Onboarding Flow](https://framer.cloud/YVcis/) (swiping, page indicator)
- [Another Onboarding Flow](https://framer.cloud/vmKSk/) (with a different treatment)
- [Floating Action Button](https://framer.cloud/zFQkt/) (show/hide/animate elements)
- [To Do App](https://framer.cloud/mHvdP/) (scrollable elements, swiping conditionals)

At ReadyTalk, our team found a lot of success prototyping with [Proto.io](http://proto.io) and [InVision](http://invisionapp.com). Overall, these are great design tools – they're simple to learn and can effectively represent workflows, interactions, etc...but they're somewhat limited in terms of functionality and overall fidelity. Our prototypes often succeeded in _getting the point across_, but even well-polished protypes required lots of additional context and explanation with our development teams.

> If you want to accurately communicate high-fidelity interactions, a verbal description or napkin sketch isn’t going to cut it. It’s worth learning how to use the tools that communicate your expertise.

So, I knew about [Framer](http://framer.com) for quite a while but always felt a little intimidated to try it – mostly because it relies almost entirely on coding :scream: and inevitably came with a pretty steep learning curve.

But it turns out that all that scary code on the left is actually _really, really simple_. 

Framer uses `CoffeeScript` – which is basically a cleaner, simpler version of JavaScript (and is really just ~2º more complicated than `CSS`). A

Framer provides really great documentation, an awesome _snippet_ library (which is like a cheat-sheet for pretty much everything), and tons of additional learning resources to get started.

If you're a designer (or just halfway curious about Framer), I urge you to give it a shot.

Here's a list of resources that I found to be really helpful:

- [New to Framer? The 3 Things to Get You Started](https://blog.framer.com/new-to-framer-just-3-things-to-get-you-started-47397f27c71e#.3x7mt2ly3): The best Framer _prerequisite_ I've seen. Definitely start here.
- [Mobile App Prototyping on Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Mobile-App-Prototyping-Designing-Custom-Interactions/382444545/): A super insightful, brief (~50 mins), and totally free class by [Noah Levin](http://nlevin.dribbble.com/), a design manager at ClassPass and Framer advocate/teacher.
- [Framer for People Who Think Things Like Framer Are Weird and Hard](https://blog.framer.com/framer-js-for-people-who-think-things-like-framer-js-are-weird-and-hard-add2068c8114#.szvqi7cp2): Another solid introductory tutorial.
- [DailyFramer](http://dailyframer.com): A fun resource from [Jon Bell](http://jonbell.co) withh daily exercises and challenges to enhance your skills (similar to [DailyUI](http://dailiyui.co)).

If you stumble upon this, please feel free to share any additional resources that help you design, prototype, and communicate your ideas as well :beers:
