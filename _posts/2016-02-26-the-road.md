I'm reading a fantastic book called [_I Am Pilgrim_](http://www.amazon.com/I-Am-Pilgrim-A-Thriller/dp/1439177732) by Terry Hayes. Today this quote jumped out at me:

> ...and for a moment he remembered what it was like to have so much road in front of you and barely any behind.”

I also turned 31 today. Which isn't a big deal...and doesn't exactly align with the above text...but everyone reflects on their road/journey/whatever from time to time. Today I'm just doing that a bit more than normal.

I suppose it's interesting to watch the landscape (and perspective) continually change.

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Now cake! :cake:
