title: Current TO DO list for this site
---
_Sigh_... I know. Another post that is clearly intended for its author alone. Hopefully that changes at some point. For now I'm just documenting and publishing as often as I can :bowtie:

Here's what needs to happen here (as I see it):

1. Add categories/tags (and archive pages, if possible)
2. [Update avatar](http://d.pr/i/114yH)
3. [Update favicon](http://d.pr/i/ZmeG)
4. Add _Influences_ page (people, books, blogs)
5. Improve fonts(currently _Arial_ for body & _Source Sans Pro_ for headings)
6. Improve [mobile header spacing](http://d.pr/i/1f3hx) (for menu, social)
7. Improve [mobile padding](http://d.pr/i/17Pl1) (too much)
9. Add other services to header (gyroscope? exposure? etc...)
10. [Fix emoji](http://d.pr/i/19wUP) on excerpts (Jekyll issue?)
11. Add disqus (or some commenting)
12. Add share stuff

Hopefully I can provide an update to this with a bunch of ~~strikethroughs~~ soon.

Also worth mentioning...one of my favorites apps, ever, is [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/). I use it pretty much daily for a variety of reasons &mdash; groceries, movies to see, books to read, beers to drink, and now TODOs on emerywebster.com.
