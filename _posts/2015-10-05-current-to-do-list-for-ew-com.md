title: Current TO DO list for this site
---
_Sigh_... I know. Another post that is clearly intended for its author alone. Hopefully that changes at some point. For now I'm just documenting and publishing as often as I can :bowtie:

Here's what needs to happen here (as I see it):

1. ~~Allow categories/tags~~
2. ~~Update avatar~~ (gravatar)
3. ~~Update favicon~~
4. Add _Influences_ page (people, books, blogs)
5. ~~Customize _About_ page~~
6. ~~Improve fonts~~ (currently _Arial_ for body & _Source Sans Pro_ for headings)
7. ~~Improve mobile header spacing~~ (for menu, social)
8. Improve [mobile padding](http://d.pr/i/17Pl1) (too much)
9. Add other services to header (gyroscope? exposure? etc...)
10. [Fix emoji](http://d.pr/i/19wUP) on excerpts (Jekyll issue?)
11. Add disqus (or some commenting)
12. Add share stuff
13. Add category/tag archive pages

Hopefully I can provide an update to this with a bunch of ~~strikethroughs~~ soon.

Also worth mentioning...one of my favorites apps, ever, is [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/). I use it pretty much daily for a variety of reasons &mdash; groceries, movies to see, books to read, beers to drink, and now TODOs on emerywebster.com.
