While working on concepts for a recent [side project](http://ifl.golf) I decided it would be a good time to dig deeper into wireframing/prototyping with [Balsamiq Mockups](http://balsamiq.com).

After a quick test drive (and watching their super helpful [guides and video tutorials](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1335124)) I quickly understood why Mockups is the go-to tool for UX &amp; interaction design:

1. **Simplicity**: limited, high-quality feature set &mdash; they're focusing on the best solution for a specific problem.
2. **Speed**: it really is _rapid_ &mdash; you can build out a minimalist version of pretty much anything in ~10-15 mins.
3. **Fun**: you get to build stuff :hammer: and it's clearly a great inbetween for design/dev/product folks.

Currently it's $89 (with a 30 day free trial)...which is totally worth it.
