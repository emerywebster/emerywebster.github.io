Learning (or building upon) any skill typically comes with a series of epiphanies &mdash; a collection of _AHA!_ moments that push you closer and closer to mastery.

This October I found one of these :bulb: moments in the golf swing (via Ben Hogan) that immediately [lowered my scores and improved my stats](http://golfshot.com/members/0871088840/). In many ways it now feels like an obvious swing thought that I overlooked for far too long.

**Here's the lesson:** Hogan prefaces his instruction by saying the most important detail is _the movement of the lower body from the top of the swing._[^1] In other words, use your hip rotation (and weight-transfer to the left side) to initiate the downswing:

You'll notice that Hogan nearly completes his downswing without making any movement with his upper body. His hip rotation performs about 80% of the work alone.

I notice this feeling most when my hips (nearly) face square to the target by the time I reach impact.  This way my hands/arms just need to release down the target line with **no extra movement needed elsewhere**. 

So (as is often the case) the surrounding theme of a great swing is one of _simplicity_.

**More from Hogan:**

- [Hogan/Tiger swing analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzIMpWTmClc) (from PGA swing coach [Wayne Defranceso](http://waynedefrancesco.com/))

[^1]:    In many writings/interviews Hogan actually references **two** critical motions in the swing: (1) the downswing action mentioned above, and (2) the initial takeaway from address. Still, the one mentioned here is certainly the most overlooked.
