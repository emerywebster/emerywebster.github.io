Ah, time to indroduce the real "intro to programming" section. This chapter[^1] is entirely about [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)...which is probably where most folks realize they're either *all in*...or lose interest completely.

Learning to program is not easy (IMO). It requires a different approach to thinking that can take some time to really comprehend (and ultimately build upon).

I'm slowly getting there, but it demands a lot of repetition and exposure to numerous (but common) concepts. I can best describe it as a 'series of epiphanies' &mdash; some of which humble your knowledge/progress...and those that further feed your desire for more.

Below are some resources that helped me to this point (in terms of actual **programming**):

- [Codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/free) : **Online Teaching Tool** : *Try Ruby* is a great place to start, followed by *Rails for Zombies* and *Ruby Bits*. Many folks find [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) and [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com)to be similarly helpful as well.
- Harvard's [CS50.tv](http://cs50.tv) : **Actual coursework** from Harvard's Intro to Computer Science (previous year) : This is really incredible. Professor David Malan does an incredible job introducing you to computer science _thinking_ and covers nearly everything you might need to know to into a deeper/narrower track.
- [Learn to Program](http://www.amazon.com/Program-Second-Edition-Facets-Series/dp/1934356360) : Great introductory **book** (that happens to also use ruby as its guide of choice).
- [Ruby in 100 Minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html) : I'm not sure where I stumbled upon this **site**, but it covers many of the basics without being too overwhelming (I'm treating this as one of the supplements to Chapter 4).

That's all for now. More to come... :shipit:
