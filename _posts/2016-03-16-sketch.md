[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) is really, really, really awesome. It's a **simple**, **useful**, and surprisingly **powerful** design tool. Here are a few things I built with it recently:

#### Fetchy

A simple web app that serves icon art from the iTunes APIÂ &mdash; [give it a try](http://fetchy.emerywebster.com/).

#### Simple Login UI

There seem to be a lot of helpful UI kits out there to shortcut this process, but I thought this would be a good excuse to get more comfortable with Sketch.

#### Calendar Icon

Again, this is the result of a quick tutorial to better understand Sketch. I particularly like the 'stacked paper' trick.

Apart from the wood texture, this is also entirely vector-based. Which is pretty neat.

Throughout these projects, I also uncovered a couple helpful tools:

- [Craft](http://www.invisionapp.com/craft) by InVision LABS: Allows you to quickly add real data to your designs (no more _lorem ipsum_ or wasted time seeking stock photography).
- [Silver](http://silverflows.com/): Craft live prototypes without ever leaving Sketch. They were recently acquired by InVision...so this will likely join the Craft plugin suite soon as well.

How are you using Sketch? :gem:
