Last night I headed up to [Galvanize Boulder](http://www.galvanize.com/campuses/boulder-west-pearl/) to check out the [Colorado Product Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Colorado-Product/). **Quick version**: they crushed it &mdash; super fun, well organized, and a friendly/smart/diverse crowd. I'm looking forward to the next event and learning from more product folks down the road.

So what's it all about? 

I think I can best answer that question by pointing to CP's website, where they ask [What is Product Management?](http://coloradoproduct.com/about/what-is-product-management/) ...And there isn't one specific answer. It's all over the place. They offer a variety of definitions and interpretations from entrepreneurs, tech leaders, lean practitioners, even Wikipedia. 

Some of these answers are super high level:

> Help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.

Others are a bit more targeted: 

> You must be able to communicate with all areas of the company. Work with an engineering counterpart to define product release requirements... Work with marketing communications to define the go-to-market strategy... Etc.

Still, you see a handful of recurring themes:

- Discover customer problems (who is the customer? what are their needs?)
- Hypothesize and test solutions (is _x_ really a problem? does _y_ successfully solve it?)
- Continually analyze market/user data (learn and iterate)
- Collaborate with engineering & UX (make tactical decisions / serve as customer voice)
- Own the overall vision (make strategic decisions / achieve business goals)
- Evangelize the product (help sell)

How PMs go about doing all of these things can obviously vary depending on your market, company/team, product goals, etc... But essentially the group serves as a resource to cultivate professional development within this **mixed bag of problem solvers**. And in some ways, the mashup nature of the product role perfectly describes the dynamic of the CP Meetup crowd as well.

I met people from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines. Startup CEOs, biz dev folks, account reps, entrepreneurs, active PMs &mdash; all with vastly different stories (and reasons for their interest in the meetup). It was a lot of fun to learn about their experiences, methods, successes, failures, goals, and journies in general. 

What what is like? Basically a hybrid of these two things:

1. Typical networking activities (~20%)
2. Team-based workshop (~80%)

We shook a lot of hands, exchanged cards, discussed backgrounds/ideas...and eventually broke off into teams to discuss and draft target [user personas](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/) for an existing product (a freely available Google Chrome extension). 

After about 20-30 mins of brainstorming/discussion each team presented a target persona to the group (which was super cool...lots of different ideas). We then gained some insight from the actual product owers as to how/why they hypothesized their initial persona, tested it, analyzed metrics/feedback, and then redefined their target persona and accompanying marketing material (keywords, landing page look/messaging, etc).

Love it. Made some great connections within my team, the organizers, and a handful of folks I met beforehand. Looking forward to many more :beers:
