Last night I headed up to [Galvanize Boulder](http://www.galvanize.com/campuses/boulder-west-pearl/) to check out the [Colorado Product Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Colorado-Product/). **Quick version**: they crushed it &mdash; super fun, well organized, and a friendly/smart/diverse crowd. I'm looking forward to the next event and learning from more product folks down the road.

So what's it all about? 

I think I can best answer that question by pointing to CP's website, where they ask [What is Product Management?](http://coloradoproduct.com/about/what-is-product-management/) ...And there really isn't a consistent answer. It's all over the place. CP offers up a variety of interpretations from various entrepreneurs, tech leaders, lean startup practitioners, and even Wikipedia. Some of these answers are super high level:

> Help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.”

Others are a bit more targeted: 

> Work with an engineering counterpart to define product release requirements... Work with marketing communications to define the go-to-market strategy... Etc.

Still, you see a handful of recurring themes:

- Discover customer problems (who is the customer? what are their needs?)
- Hypothesize and test solutions (is _x_ really a problem? how can we best fix it?)
- Continually analyze market/user data (learn and iterate)
- Collaborate with engineering & UX (make tactical decisions / serve as customer voice)
- Own the overall vision (make strategic decisions / achieve business goals)
- Evangelize the product (help sell)

How you go about doing all of these things can obviously vary depending on your market, company/team, and product goals... But essentially the group serves as a resource to cultivate professional development within this **weird, murky, mixed bag** of problem solvers. And in some ways, the mashup nature of the product role perfectly describes the dynamic of the CP Meetup crowd as well.

I met folks from a variety of backgrounds and interests. Startup CEOs, biz dev folks, account reps, entrepreneurs, active product managers&mdash;all from vastly different backgrounds. It's a lot of fun to hear stories of their varying experiences, goals, strategies, methods, successes, failures, and journies in general. 

What did we do? Basically a hybrid of these two things:

1. Typical networking stuff (~20%)
2. Team-based workshop (~80%)

We shook a lot of hands, exchanged cards, discussed backgrounds/ideas, and eventually broke off into teams for a learning exercise about [user persona](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/) definition. I got to know the people in my team pretty well and am exicted to connect and stay in touch with them down the road.

I'm guessing most folks found the format to be fun and beneficial, so hopefully it will be a recurring trend for upcoming meetups as well.

Other meetups I recommend:

- [Refresh Denver](http://www.meetup.com/refreshdenver/): (2.5k) Mostly designers &amp; developers with talks from industry leaders in various disciplines. Largely discussing web trends and/or product design.
- [New Tech Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/bdnewtech/): (11k+) Largely presentations/pitches for new companies and ideas. All over the place.
